# Flashcards

[![CI](https://github.com/cravay/flashcards/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cravay/flashcards/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Flashcards is a basic full stack [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) application which allows users to manage
and learn [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard). It consists of a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) server
and a [React](https://reactjs.org/) client. This Repository is managed using the [Nx](https://nx.dev/) build system.

## Quickstart

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Node 16 LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:cravay/flashcards.git`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Create .env file and edit its values: `cp .env.example .env`
- Start Postgres database: `docker compose -p flashcards -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
- Apply database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Start this app: `npm start`

The following apps will be started:

- Client: http://localhost:4200
- Server: http://localhost:3333 (Swagger-UI: http://localhost:3333/api)

## Commonly used scripts

- Start: `npm start`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Database

Data is persisted in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Database which is accessed and managed using the [Primsa ORM](https://www.prisma.io/).
The data in the database can be viewed using [Prisma studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio): `npx prisma studio`.

## Continuous Integration / Deployment

Every time a commit is pushed to the main branch, this project gets linted, tested and built using
the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) defined in [ci.yml](https://github.com/cravay/flashcards/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
All the outputs get cached using [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/) ([in this organization](https://nx.app/orgs/624ddb8a81e08f00053c551c/workspaces/624ddbbc2a9400251c0f601f))
and builds get pushed to the [client-build](https://github.com/cravay/flashcards/tree/client-build)
branch and the [server-build](https://github.com/cravay/flashcards/tree/server-build) branch.

The project gets deployed to the [render](https://render.com/) cloud. Every time a build is pushed to a build branch it
gets automatically deployed. The following services have been manually created:

- Static Site: https://flashcards-7vuj.onrender.com/
- Node Web Service: https://flashcards-server.onrender.com/
- PostgreSQL Database

## Tree-Shaking issues

Due to the bug [nrwl/nx#9717](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/9717) tree-shaking currently doesn't work for client builds. For some reason unknown to me, the [side effects optimization of webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationsideeffects) got disabled for Nx 12. There's a [PR to reenable them](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/8296), but until that gets merged the side effects optimization can get manually re-enabled like this (This reduces the bundle size by over 90%):

```bash
sed --in-place s/sideEffects:\ false/sideEffects:\ true/ node_modules/\@nrwl/web/src/utils/config.js
```

The bundle of a client build can get analyzed using [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) like this:

```bash
nx build client --source-map
npx source-map-explorer dist/apps/client/main.*.js
```
